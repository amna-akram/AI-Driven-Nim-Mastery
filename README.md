# AI-Driven-Nim-Mastery
Implementation of Q-learning algorithm for an AI mastering the game of Nim.

# Overview
This project implements an AI for playing the game of Nim using reinforcement learning, specifically the Q-learning algorithm. The AI learns to make optimal moves through self-play, gradually improving its strategy over multiple training episodes.

# Project Structure
nim.py: Defines the Nim and NimAI classes, providing the game logic and structure for the AI. It also includes functions for training and playing.

play.py: Allows you to test the trained AI by playing a few games against it.

# How to run
Run the play.py script:
python play.py

# Playing Against the Trained AI
1. After the training is complete, the script will prompt you to play five games against the trained AI.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your moves during each game.
3. Observe the AI's strategy and attempt to play strategically to win against it.
